Sulekha Kosliya M is a first-year Ph.D student in the Department of Chemistry at Case Western Reserve University, working under the supervision of Dr. Yihang Wang. Her research focuses on integrating reinforcement learning with molecular dynamics simulations to study biomolecular systems. She is currently developing and applying RL-based frameworks for enhanced sampling and data-driven analysis of molecular simulations.

She holds an M.Sc. in Chemistry from Mahatma Gandhi University, where she graduated with first rank, and a B.Sc. in Chemistry from the University of Calicut. Prior to joining CWRU, she was a research intern at Michigan Technological University (2024), where she conducted computational Chemistry research involving density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations applied to biomolecular systems.
