We are particularly excited by questions such as:

- How can we build **accurate and efficient models** for large biomolecular systems across time and length scales?
- Can we develop **transferable enhanced sampling strategies** that go beyond a single system?
- Instead of making AI *explainable*, can we use **AI to explain molecular dynamics simulations** themselves?

To tackle these challenges, we combine **statistical mechanics, molecular dynamics, and machine learning**, and we actively seek new ways to rethink long-standing problems in molecular science.

## Who We’re Looking For

We welcome **curious and motivated researchers** from diverse backgrounds, including (but not limited to):

- Chemistry  
- Physics  
- Biophysics  
- Biology  
- Computer Science  
- Applied Mathematics  
- Materials Science  

Experience with **enhanced sampling, coarse-grained modeling, or AI for chemistry** is a plus—but not a requirement.  
What matters most is intellectual curiosity, a strong quantitative foundation, and an interest in interdisciplinary research.
