My name is Yihang Wang, a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the Biophysics Program at the University of Maryland, College Park, advised by Prof. Pratyush Tiwary. 

I have a general interest in studying complex systems. In particular, I hope my work can bring us new understanding to living systems. My current research focuses on the interface between statistical mechanics, machine learning, and molecular dynamics simulations. I am using ideas from these areas to explores how biomolecules interact with small molecules.
